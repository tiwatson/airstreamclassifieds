In addition, I have had the following items also added and will include with the trailer, bedside book rack; key rack inside cupboard; extra airstream throw cushions; two sets of Airstream sheets and pillow cases; outside ground cover; IPOD interface for stereo system and a portable satellite dish. This is the perfect size trailer for towing with todays high gas prices. It can easily be towed with an SUV instead ofa truck. I use a Toyota FJ Cruiser which looks like a fat jeep. This double axle design tows easier and more efficiently then the single axle Bambi.

The exterior is in good shape too -- just a couple small dents. This trailer is absolutely BONE DRY! No leaks, no moisture, no sign of water inside, ever. Sleeps four or more comfortably. Highlights include: Wrap-around windows/guards; (light/neutral color) plush upholstery, carpet and drapes; ice-cold A/C unit; AM/FM stereo cassette with speakers throughout the unit; full-size refrigerator; power tongue jack; door-side and curbside Dee-Zee awnings; cedar-lined, lighted wardrobe closets; FOUR BRAND NEW TIRES; plenty of storage, etc. etc. Title in hand, tabs good through March 2012. I'll post a few pics with this ad, and you can see more photos here.

Interior is a tasteful color palette of light golden honey with olive accent colors.  Walnut Wood Cabinetry with Mirror accents. Floor-plan is spacious but does not include a dinette and does not have slideouts; it has two fold-up tables that function perfectly for up to 4-5 people!  All linoleum floors are in great condition (a few un-noticeable knicks here and there from normal wear and tear). No creaks or soft spots on the floor itself; i.e. no water damage.  A queen sized faux-Tempurpedic mattress included (with lift up storage underneath).  Entertainment/Computer Center with a non-original 23\" flat screen Samsung TV installed.  Spacious, mirrored closets are great for longer travel.  Kitchen includes a microwave, a brand new Norcold refrigerator/freezer (two-way: gas/electric) has replaced the original Dometic Refrigerator (no panels).  Slate-gray Corian counter tops, three-burner gas range and gas oven, magnetic strip knife holder, wine glass rack, Pots and pans, matching dinnerware: its a ready-to-go travel kitchen!  This Airstream includes a spacious bathroom with separate toilet and shower (not a \u201cwet-bath\u201d). Lots of storage.  Environmental accommodations includes the original Air Conditioner, Electric Heat Pump, and Gas Furnace, skylights: including two FantasicFan Roof Vents with \"rain sensors\".  On the exterior are four awnings with 2 matching outdoor folding chairs.  Main Awning does have some slight damage due to regular wear'n'tear and damage from a severe wind storm a few years ago - Awning still pulls out fine and retracts with a little bit of effort, also does have a small tear in fabric, but overall in good, usable condition.  Aluminum skin has a few dings and dents from a Hail storm and rocks off the HWY when it was towed. Has a brand new Water Pressure Regulator and Electrical inlet.  Propane tank shroud has approx. 5\u201d dent in it due to accidentally leaving the tailgate down and making a sharp turn. It has approximately 15,000 road miles on the chassis, and has new tires on it (Nitrogen filled).  Comes with brand new Wheel Covers and a Sway-Bar system.   I bought it in 2005 Brand New for about $74,000, I've lowered my max asking price to $36,000 (negotiable).  Contact me for Payment options as there is still a $15,000 lien remaining.  It\u2019s registered in Florida, so the e-Title will be release only after the Loan is cleared.  I describe it as being in \u201cGreat\" Condition as it has been lived in full-time for 6 smoke-free years, and maintained throughout that time; hasn't been towed in 3 years so brakes, etc may be a little stiff.  I\u2019ve put at least $3000 worth of maintenance into it between 2009-2012.  Keep in mind this is a heavy Trailer: dry/empty, it weighs approx 8,000 lbs!  I\u2019ve weighed it with tanks full and all my personal belongings in it and the GW came to about 10,000 lbs!  Its currently located in Belle Chasse, LA (Westbank) and because I am not local (I live in California), nor do I have a Vehicle to tow this any distances, the buyer must be willing to accept \u201cas is\u201d and where it is; i.e. Local pick-up only!    I am a Navy pilot now stationed in California and this Airstream has lovingly served as my full-time home from 2005-June 2011.  I was not able to take it with me when I moved, nor do I have the means or desire to move it to California or keep it any longer.  I've taken very good care of it and it\u2019s been a very comfortable, reliable, fully furnished \"apartment\"!!  I\u2019d like to see it go to a serious Airstreamer who will get the same great experience out of it!    If interested or have any questions, please contact me via airstreamforums.com.  I will be out of the country on business until early April, so any interested persons must coordinate with me a time to meet after April 2nd as I do not live locally.  Thank you.   *Please note:  all photos were taken when I was still living in it.  I\u2019ve since removed all my belongings out.

It has a front dinette, 3 burner stove with oven, decent sized refrigerator, and efficient and adequate storage. In the rear is a 48' bed and toilet with separate shower. The water heater has electronic ignition, and the water pump is under the dinette, not the bed! Awning, stone guards, and windows and blinds or curtains are like new.\nThis Bambi was set up for vacationing in unimproved campgrounds.\u00a0It is fitted with a 6 amp solar battery charging package and two 88 ah deep cycle batteries. We have used it for week-long or more vacations and found the batteries fully charged each afternoon. It is also fitted with a 2000 watt inverter for AC appliances and tools, adequate for a toaster, coffee maker, a small microwave oven, and for my quilt-making wife's sewing machine.\u00a0\nPer advice from Randy at Best Converter, I also installed a Trimetric battery monitor and a PD 4655 converter. Other features include a Fantastic Fan in the front vent hatch, AC (which requires shore power), a surprisingly comfortable bed with storage underneath.

You just need to bring your own toothbrush and you are ready for the road. This is an Airstream and be it daily use or summer weekends this travel trailer can handle it. It is hardy enough to stand up to daily use and designed such that it is a comfortable place to be. I have modified it to accommodate myself: I tore the wrap around curtain system out and put in simple Ikea roman curtains, I tore out the carpeting and put in solid Bamboo flooring (just wipe clean), I removed one dining bench and built a bench perpendicular to the remaining bench against the front of the Bambi so that I could stretch out (there is a lot of extra storage under this bench), I modified the dining table so that it can be stowed and thus opening up the main living area, I installed an alternate system to heat the water tank via 120v (less expensive than heating it with propane), I installed a ceiling fan that can rotate either way to expel air or bring it in (very nice trick that cools the Bambi with just 12v instead of the the 120v AC system).\n The kitchen is all one needs. The propane range is a pleasure to cook on and the exhaust fan helps with the moisture. The fridge was plenty big enough for me and has a freezer compartment. There is plenty of storage for food and cooking gadgets. The bath is a little cramped, but offers the privacy of a door. The shower is nice sized. There is a separate bath sink with storage medicine cabinet. The bed sleeps two. I am 5'11\" and I am comfortable (taller people would find it too small). The second bed is made by laying the dining table flush with the benches and using the cushions as a mattress.\n The reason I am listing this below what you are seeing asked for similar Airstreams is that it has exterior damage. I have traveled the states and bumped a few things along the way. The worst of it was in Arizona: who expects snow in Arizona? I jackknifed on an off ramp - my Toyota Tundra has a matching dent. It is a nice size dent. The inside is intact and most importantly there are no areas where water enters the interior. I think that repairing the dent would entail getting a panel from Airstream - I do not think these can be pounded out. I never bothered because of the expense and the fact that I am more of function person than form person.\u00a0\n I am the second owner. I purchased this Airstream in June 2007. I am leaving the country and this does not fit into the overhead.\n Hope this helps.\nWally\n954.683.3528\n\u00a0\nP.S. If I did not mention this in my email response, I have a tow vehicle for sale. A beaut: 1997 Ford F-250 Heavy Duty 7.3 liter Powerstroke Diesel, 4x4, 8' bed, less than 170k miles, manual, 2 door with rear folding seat, power doors and windows, cruise control, a/c, factory stereo, dual tanks, 7 plug-brake control-receiving hitch, new tires, recent service to include a/c, repacked bearings, oil change, air filter, fuel filter, power steering flush, brake fluid flush, transmission case service, front and rear differential service and alignment. This is a low maintenance diesel with a coveted engine that will last for hundreds of thousands miles more.

The trailer is here at my home, and if you'd like to come by and see it in person, you're more than welcome, please just give us a call to set up a time 520-561-6091.  You can email me with questions, but it's best to call if you need answers immediately.  I have bought several things on ebay over the years, but selling on here is something I haven't done, so please bear with me.  We are listing this Airstream at NO RESERVE, so it will have a new home at the end of the auction.  He is the second owner of this trailer (since 2007 I believe) and he is extremely particular about his vehicles, you'll know if you see it in person, this trailer has had very little use and has been loved.  The only \"damage\" that I'm aware of is the SS rock guard on the left front, it has some waves or dents in it (see pictures), he said it's been like that since he got it.  The tires appear to be in great condition, they have lots of tread and being stored in a climate-controlled RV garage, they have no weather cracking, etc. but he says they are the tires that came on the trailer (it's an 05' but was purchased new in 06') so if I was going to tow it accross country I'd put a new set on it.  It has a new spare as well, still has the tag on the side of it.  Stove has never been cooked on or in, and it has never been showered in.\nYou can reach me at 520-561-6091 any time if you need more information or you want to come take a look.  We live on the east side of town in Tucson, AZ.

I think it just needs a new power switch but haven't investigated too deeply because I had no use for A/C. Heater cranks! Hot water and shower work perfectly.\nExtensive electrical install done by myself(a marine electrician)includes a year old Xantrex MS3000 inverter/charger which produces 3000 watts of sine wave output. Also includes 4 x L16 golf cart batteries to power all your A/C needs and then some. I will also include 2 huge roll up flexible Solar panels for boondocking...stay unplugged indefinitely. (4 L16, 6 volt batteries wired in parallel gives you over 700 amp hours). The Xantrax MS3000 inverter/charger retails for $1800-$2000 and the batteries are about $400/per and will last on average 7-10 years if taken care of properly.\nBuilt-in 3/4\" African Mahogany console in the living room area with shelve space.\nHeavy duty Reece hitch with weight distribution and sway bars. Trailer pulls/tracks true and smooth. No rust, trailer has been in CA it's whole life until last year.\nThe clear coat is peeling but finish is still in great shape for it's age.

It has a spacious kitchen with ample counter space.\u00a0 A spice rack, pull out pantry, two flat screen HDTV\u2019s, and two wardrobes are all built in features not found in many other models. Additionally it is packed full of the genius ideas of Airstream engineers like storage under the bed, under the dinette, under the couch and of course in the over head bins.\u00a0 \nAs we de-winterized the trailer this spring my wife and I decided it was time for a little extra TLC.\u00a0 We had every inch of the interior professionally cleaned, including a steam clean of the couch, dinette, and walls and also had the cushion covers and window treatments dry cleaned. We replaced the batteries, the tires, had the brakes checked and the bearings repacked.\u00a0 We even went as far as to replace the screens on the windows and doors.\u00a0 All told it cost just over $2000. Basically there isn\u2019t an Airstream that is more road ready or in better condition available anywhere.\u00a0 \nIf you are still deciding if an Airstream is right for you, know that in the world of travel trailers and recreational vehicles, there is no name more associated with quality and longevity than Airstream.\u00a0 And as if that weren\u2019t enough, Airstreams tow up to 20% more fuel efficiently than other travel trailers.\u00a0 With gas prices on the rise, that ends up being a very valuable feature.\nWe hate to see her go but I have been transferred and bringing our beloved Airstream is just not an option.\nFeel free to contact me with any questions or for a laundry list of all the features 970-481-5400","id":203,"listed_at":"2011-06-14T12:00:00-07:00","location":"Littleton, CO","make_model":"Safari","price":38900,"price_last":38900,"product":13142,"removed_at":"2011-06-29T22:25:35-07:00","size":25,"sold":false,"title":"2006 75th Anniversary Edition 25\u2019 SS","updated_at":"2011-06-29T22:25:35-07:00","url":"http://www.airstreamclassifieds.com/showproduct.php?product=13142&cat=16","year":2006},{"created_at":"2011-06-18T22:25:16-07:00","days_active":74,"description":"Excellent condition.\u00a0Includes second TV in bedroom  Wired for DirecTv.Just detailed in and outNon-Smoking and only one owner.","id":213,"listed_at":"2011-06-12T12:00:00-07:00","location":"Napa Valley, California","make_model":"International Ocean Breeze  anniversary edition","price":45000,"price_last":0,"product":13116,"size":25,"sold":true,"title":"2007 25' International Ocean Breeze","updated_at":"2011-08-25T22:25:18-07:00","url":"http://www.airstreamclassifieds.com/showproduct.php?product=13116&cat=16","year":2007},{"created_at":"2011-07-20T22:25:14-07:00","days_active":61,"description":"2 owners, very clean, kept under roof.

For sale is a triple axle Airstream Classic Excella with twin beds. This is the largest travel trailer Airstream makes, and this one is in better condition than any other 80's (or 90's for that matter) Airstream I have ever seen. There's a reason: this unit spent 4 months at the Airstream factory getting a full makeover in '06. The prior owners spent more than $16K there. At that time, they performed a clearcoat replacement on the exterior and did some other exterior improvements, including repainting the bottom, replacing the wheels, and countless odds and ends. They also put in all new laminate flooring. I have all of those records. Since I have owned the Airstream, I replaced the refrigerator, the carpet, the radio and speakers, have repacked the bearings, purchased two batteries, and installed the latest and greatest off-air antenna (\"The Jack\"). I can provide all invoices (I have scanned all of them) and can provide additional pictures if you wish. You simply will not find a better Excella, and while you might find one cheaper, it will cost way too much in improvements to bring another one up to this condition.

It has a spacious kitchen with ample counter space.\u00a0 A spice rack, pull out pantry, two flat screen HDTV\u2019s, and two wardrobes are all built in features not found in many other models. Additionally it is packed full of the genius ideas of Airstream engineers like storage under the bed, under the dinette, under the couch and of course in the over head bins.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nAs we de-winterized the trailer this spring my wife and I decided it was time for a little extra TLC.\u00a0 We had every inch of the interior professionally cleaned, including a steam clean of the couch, dinette, and walls and also had the cushion covers and window treatments dry cleaned. We replaced the batteries, the tires, had the brakes checked and the bearings repacked.\u00a0 We even went as far as to replace the screens on the windows and doors.\u00a0 All told it cost just over $2000. Basically there isn\u2019t an Airstream that is more road ready or in better condition available anywhere.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIf you are still deciding if an Airstream is right for you, know that in the world of travel trailers and recreational vehicles, there is no name more associated with quality and longevity than Airstream.\u00a0 And as if that weren\u2019t enough, Airstreams tow up to 20% more fuel efficiently than other travel trailers.\u00a0 With gas prices on the rise, that ends up being a very valuable feature.\n\u00a0\nWe hate to see her go but I have been transferred and bringing our beloved Airstream is just not an option.\n\u00a0\nFeel free to contact me with any questions or for a laundry list of all the features 970-481-5400","id":233,"listed_at":"2011-06-30T12:00:00-07:00","location":"Littleton, CO","make_model":"Safari","price":37000,"price_last":0,"product":13292,"size":25,"sold":true,"title":"Super Clean 2006 75th Anniversary Edition Safari 25\u2019 SS -- Must See!","updated_at":"2011-07-09T22:26:20-07:00","url":"http://www.airstreamclassifieds.com/showproduct.php?product=13292&cat=16","year":2006},{"created_at":"2011-07-01T22:25:14-07:00","days_active":31,"description":"Reduced price for quick sale.

Used all season every year from May to October. We're reluctantly selling it only because we\"ve upgraded to a 34' Limited for additional space.\nThe Safari has two new fantastic fans; four newer Goodyear Tires with less than 500 miles; all new laminate flooring throughout; new deep cycle battery, as our summer home we have maintained the systems regularly. It has all the other usual Airstream amenities.\nWe purchased this unit with factory rear twin beds but it has been carefully converted to full size bed. Easily returned to twins if desired, have all mattresses and parts. Otherwise the unit has a front lounge and center bath. The unit would sleep four as configured.\nI have towed the Safari over the road a few times, brakes and all road systems worked properly. Included with the Safari is a Reese weight distributing hitch system. I have towed this with my 2003 Toyota Tundra but wouldn't recommend anything much smaller.\nThe Safari could use a good pressure wash and detailing on the exterior. We have no facility here for that. The previous owner left some dings on the skin which are cosmetic only. The awning is fully operational, the fabric is fine but the mechanics could use some minor attention. Additional details and further photographs can be provided on request.Here's a link to Flickr where I have posted a  number of pictures of my 1997 Airstream 25 foot Safari.http://www.flickr.com/photos/65202953@N07/\nThe Safari is in storage in our campground in Hampton Falls NH and can be seen by appointment, asking $14,000 or best offer.\nPlease contact Mike at 781-245-4582 or by email at oconnell.50@gmail.com\n\u00a0","id":254,"listed_at":"2011-07-07T12:00:00-07:00","location":"Hampton Falls, NH","make_model":"Airstream Safari","price":14000,"price_last":0,"product":13346,"size":25,"sold":true,"title":"1997 Safari 25' Wide Body","updated_at":"2011-09-05T22:25:16-07:00","url":"http://www.airstreamclassifieds.com/showproduct.php?product=13346&cat=16","year":1997},{"created_at":"2011-07-05T22:25:17-07:00","days_active":19,"description":"MINT 2006 31ft AIRSTREAM CLASSIC LIMITED 75th Anniversary Edition widebody travel trailer.\nBeautiful condition\u2026.better than new\u2026.one owner, only 6 within state trips useage!

This  is a one owner travel trailer bought new in early 2005 and used for one  trip to Oregon and back that lasted 4 1/2 months and 5,100 miles. It has  been stored ever since and not used.\nIt was used by a young woman that  only used park facilities. This is the buy of the year for any Airstream  fan. The toilet is still in its original wrapper and never used with  the original toilet paper still there , the shower has never been used,  the refrigerator has never been used, it still has the packing tape  holding down the tray. The clear plastic protective film is still on the  stainless steel front of the refrigerator.\nAs you can see the stove is  like it was never used with very limited use to it, the two LP gas tanks  have never been refilled. The gas furnace has only been fired during  the factory test. It still has the original plastic over the mattress.  Everything about this RV is in new condition.\nThe exterior is in almost  perfect condition with no stone marks, dents or dings and only 2 small  scratches on the right rear lower panel that was there when she bought  it, it looks brand new all over. The sewer hookup has not been used, it  has the television antenna, air conditioning, roof vented fan with rain  sensor, panoramic view windows with dark shade guards and body stone  guards, tank guards, electric hook up cable, water hose,everything you  need to start your journey.\nIt even comes with the Airstream 2\" Receiver  Hitch with stablelizer bars for your vehicle. It has been kept up with  all lights working and electric brakes cleaned and checked. It is a very  clean RV inside and out.  This travel trailer has been stored outside and there are 3 issues to  disclose.\nFirst - the light cover over the license plate has corroded  and needs replaced. Why this was steel and not aluminum is a mystery?  anyway a $20 fix.\nSecond - there was an issue with the panoramic window  having a leak problem from the factory, with this RV sitting and not  being used or watched closely there is some flooring that will need to  be replaced under the table area about 3' from the front back. This is  in the area that is under the table/seat section and an easy fix with  3/4\" OSB flooring and minimal cost.\nThird - it will need a new RV  battery and battery connector as the original is well past its life span  and has been removed. Over all this is a great RV in almost new  condition and only 4 1/2 months use, it needs a small amount of TLC to  get going and what an opportunity to save thousands over the $40,000   price of a new one.\nI have more pics I can send or I will be happy to  show you this RV in person or discuss it over the phone. Below is the  specs for this RV as close as I can find.\nPlease call me to see, Tim  Dalton 513-616-4048. There is an amount owed on this RV so the title  will have to go through the proper channels. It was bought for $35,000  new in 2005 and I believe this is a fair price to ask.","id":1120,"listed_at":"2012-09-02T12:00:00-07:00","location":"CINCINNATI OHIO","make_model":"AIRSTREAM BAMBI INTERNATIONAL","price":25800,"price_last":25800,"product":16981,"removed_at":"2012-09-05T22:25:10-07:00","size":16,"sold":false,"title":"2004 BAMBI INTERNATIONAL 16","updated_at":"2012-09-05T22:25:10-07:00","url":"http://www.airstreamclassifieds.com/showproduct.php?product=16981&cat=16","year":2004},{"created_at":"2011-06-25T22:25:17-07:00","days_active":149,"description":"75th Aniversary Edition 2006 Safari 20' Bambi.

This is the absolute best safety device you can have on your Airstream as it will not allow any trailer sway \u2013 ever.  Plus, it makes towing much easier and you can even turn sharper than using the traditional hitch setup.

We got it new in 2009 and have thoroughly  enjoyed it on fly fishing expeditions in Northern California--and one trip to Santa Barbara to see The Buffalo Springfield. The thing  has been meticulously cared for by my Type-A wife and looks as close to  brand new as I think you can get. The interior of the CCD models like  this one have sleekly rounded modernist overhead cabinets and, of  course, lots of exposed aluminum. The other cabinets and partitions are  in a dark wood-grained material and the dinette cushions are what  I think Airstream calls Paprika. It tows really easily. We removed the leveler  hitch the dealer up-sold us (we being easy marks at the time), yet we  never feel the trailer moving around in high winds or when passing big  rigs; that's how good it tows. I really like how easy it is to tuck the  trailer into small sites at State Parks and when boondocking. You can get the specs from the Airstream site or other ads for other 19' Internationals on this site.

This is really a new trailer without the new trailer price. I'm replacing it with a larger Airstream Classic model because I've decided to go full timing earlier than planned and want more living space.\nA nice feature is the panoramic windows on both ends of the trailer that bring in lots of light and provide a great view of the outdoors. Besides the original cushions and backrests, additional matching cushions and backrests are included that transform the dinette area into cohesive looking lounging area (great for reading and watching TV). That is an $800 value. The queen bed has a comfortable foam mattress with the original quilted bedspread.\nThe Flying Cloud 27FB comes with two full 60 lb propane tanks; 25,000 BTU furnace, 15,000 BTU air conditioner, microwave, oven, 22 inch HD LED TV connected to DVD player, CD player for music, LED lighting, external shower, and 30 amp main power cord. I had a 600-watt inverter added in the bedroom for our CPAP machines. See invoice image for more features.\nThe trailer is available for inspection in Anoka, Minnesota. There are no dents or scratches in the aluminum skin. Email with phone number to make inspection and/or other purchase arrangements.","id":600,"listed_at":"2012-01-28T12:00:00-08:00","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","make_model":"Airstream Flying Cloud 27FB","price":54800,"price_last":54800,"product":14833,"removed_at":"2012-02-24T21:25:53-08:00","size":28,"sold":false,"title":"2011 Airstream Flying Cloud 27FB","updated_at":"2012-02-24T21:25:53-08:00","url":"http://www.airstreamclassifieds.com/showproduct.php?product=14833&cat=16","year":2011},{"created_at":"2012-02-25T21:25:07-08:00","days_active":60,"description":"This is a beautiful International version , has all the standard equipment plus a custom wood plank floor and upgraded sound system.

I went to vegas in this unit so it will be available for deliver on or before feb 10. But we can start showing immediately.\nwell...things change.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This was my \"gonna keep this one forever airstream\"...but, Due to some personal issues and change in circumstance I have bought back into a foundation home in Las Vegas and just think its time to let her go down the road.\u00a0 You will not find another one like this.\nIts a 1988 32'excella 1000. This camper needs nothing to travel, live fulltime or run about the country it is fully functional! Ill start with listing all the new that I can remember on it.\nA brand new camping world installed Penguin Dometic Air conditioner (the old one actually worked but I was replacing everything to new!) In July it got a new dometic 2801 refridgerator. All of the faucets are new (home grade Moens) and the water from sink to shower are leak tight!\nA new Thetford toilet was installed in August. The rear quarters of this unit are set up for the leisure enthusiest with leather recliners and a 60\" flat screen!! Custom large storage too!! The queen bed has been put up in the front of the unit and a 19\" flat panel mounted on the wall in the bed chamber, and the old little tv stand has been replaced with a beautiful walnut rolltop desk and pier one chair. It is a fantastic work and computer area.\nIn September new wheels and 10 ply tires were put on it, It rode 1,100 miles to get to Vegas from Missouri and look as new with no wear on them.\nThere is a custom platform on the tongue of this unit that easily accomodates your generator and a 600lb motorcyle. Yes, an airstream toy hauler! The windows have been static tinted and all have insulation inserts in them. There are Fantastics front and rear!\nAll of the counters and sinks are in very nice unmarked/stained condition, the oven, stove and water heater all work as they should. I had camping world put a new jack surelock lowprofile black antenna on at the same time they did the AC.\nCarpet is clean and in good condition. Even the original control panel (minus outdoor temp) is in working order. Had enough...not yet, I have $5K dollars worth of solar components on this rig! 2800W of panels on top and a legend 3K watt inverter that is professionally hard wired to the entire unit, every outlet, and controlled with a specialtiy concepts Mark 15 controller, it will run everything except the AC it will run the fan on the unit but not enough to turn or maintain the compressor!!! It is an AWESOME system that can have you drydocking in luxury!!\nIt will come with the trunion style equalizer bars and hitch/head unit!! The skins on this rig have been cleaned and all of the old weather checked decals have been replaced. as for the interior it is down to little details that I wanted to finish like an end table in the theather and I would have liked to replace the old cassette radio..but it does still work!\nThere is one big issue left to deal with. there are 4 panels with damage on the passenger side rear quarter, 2 significant and 2 moderate. The unit does not leak and it does not show on the inside. I had recieved a email photo quote of $4K from Inland to repair the damage. that was the spring time project, Now I have to pass that on to the new owner. It is the only issue known to me and does not effect the immediate useability in any way!\nDuring the previous owners possesion in Missouri a tree fell during a storm coming to rest on the damaged area. He pushed the dents out but did not have the panels replaced. I am the 3rd owner, I have all of the original books and brochures along with service records since the day it was bought!\nTo Date I have $14,950 invested in this unit and truth be told I would in fact kind of like to keep it given the effort put into it, However..I would also like to furnish my new home, so it really does need to go.\nSo I am asking $11,950 obo.\nThe Genset on the unit is not included in the price but I can let it go for an additional $1500 or negotiate it into the deal if you like.\nThis unit is In Las Vegas and can be seen by appt. I can take whatever pictures for an out of town buyer. Just email me with any questions, thank you for looking!!","id":539,"listed_at":"2011-12-21T12:00:00-08:00","location":"Las Vegas NV","make_model":"Airstream Excella 1000","price":11950,"price_last":0,"product":14578,"size":32,"sold":true,"title":"'88 Airstream Excella 1000 32'","updated_at":"2012-01-06T21:26:09-08:00","url":"http://www.airstreamclassifieds.com/showproduct.php?product=14578&cat=16","year":1988},{"created_at":"2011-12-30T21:25:09-08:00","days_active":11,"description":"\u00a0\n1987 Airstream Sovereign 25 for sale\n\u00a0\nGreat condition overall and ready to travel! $17,900 OBO.\n\u00a0\n25 ft. with side bath and rear twin beds. 5100 lbs. dry weight, 700 lbs. hitch weight, GVWR 6800 lbs. Sleeps 3 to 4. Owned by non-smokers. Located in Birmingham, AL.\n\u00a0\nWe overhauled this camper from 10/2009 to 3/2010 and installed all new: furnace, rv refrigerator (3-way Norcold), Atwood gas range/oven, Carrier A/C (15,000 btu heat pump with heat strip), water heater (atwood XT with DSI).\n\u00a0\nInterior is in excellent condition. Carpet was replaced with easy care oak look vinyl. All counters, toilet, sinks and faucets have been replaced. Kitchen faucet has pull out sprayer. We re-upholstered with marine grade vinyl, (the covers on the mattresses are removable), The curtain fabric is from Hilo, HI and is washable. (I pre-washed the fabric before construction and they have been removed and washed once already.) Vinyl shades are also present. According to previous owners records the mattresses were replaced in 2006. We also replaced all of the window screens and added clear snap- off vinyl panels to the screen door so it functions like a storm door.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere are front and rear tvs and dvd players. Both Tv\u2019s are on an arms that swing out so that they have a wide view angle. There is a space saver coffee pot by Black and decker and a microwave oven.\n\u00a0\nThe trailer was serviced by an airstream tech at Camping World on 01/30/2009. We had the bearings serviced, brakes checked, etc. Tires were replaced before we bought it in 2008. The DOT code on the tires is 2205 for the manufacture date (22nd week of 2005) but I don\u2019t know exactly when they were installed. We bought a new tire for the spare since the old one on it looked terrible. We have always kept the tires covered while parked and they still look good. The tire covers attach to rails on the side of the trailer. They are easy to install and remove.\n\u00a0\nAll awnings are in good working order. We replaced the Z-lock on the main awning and some of the locking pins. We also added Zip-dee lift \u201chelpers\u201d. The side and rear awnings are a nice addition especially in the summer.\n\u00a0\nExterior:\n\u00a0\nNo leaks since we overhauled it, we did have one at the front roof vent but it has been sealed. We used sikaflex on the vent and aluminum parr bond on the seams. (No silicone has been used on exterior!)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe typical clearcoat flaking is present on the top. There are some dents (see photos). The front and rear upper driver side has dents but we decided to leave them alone since they do not affect the function of the trailer. (no leaks or other problems). There is a slight dent near the porch light. There is also a long scuff on the driver\u2019s side and a scuff on the front below the window.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe TV antenna is original. We replaced the gasket around the front window rock guards and the rear storage compartments.\u00a0 The propane tanks and regulator were replaced with new in 2009. There are two Maxx air vent covers installed. All owners manuals are present.

So you don\u2019t spend your vacation maintaining the trailer. \u00a0I used it mostly as a base camp at weekend bike races. \u00a0The holding tanks have never had any formaldahyde in them since I always dumped and flushed them in my shop right after each event.When I was not using the SS 17 it was stored in my shop, so it has spent most of its short life indoors. and is in excellent condition.I\u2019m a non smoker, no pets, it's waxed and ready to roll out.Upgrades:Tossed the OEM Microwave and installed a reliable Sharp microwave-convection oven.Vacuumed out 3 pounds of sawdust and aluminum chipsVarnished the raw plywood under the Bed/CouchReplaced the stock cooling fan on the Fridge with a quieter oneReplaced the outside all plastic shower faucet with a brass/chrome unitI towed this with a sprinter and once with a ford explorer, its only 3,500 pounds and only 7\u20196\u201d wide so I recall that a lot of cars can tow it but I don\u2019t have any direct experience.

Designer David Winick took the lead in creating an interior space that is both ultra modern and retrospective. Natural linoleum in warm tones brings out the highlights of genuine wood veneers. Upholstery inspired by 1940's tailoring heightens textural contrasts, reflecting in an array of aluminum surfaces. Porthole windows, round vents and yacht-inspired details further integrate the past and future in this very special travel trailer.\"Layout:Dinette is is angled for easier accessSignificently more floor space (sofa slide-out) and transfer of fridge from street side to curb sideEasier access to bathroom when bed converted to couchCombo bed/sofa - bed can optionally be converted to a couch for day useShoulder height cupboarders have been reduced in size to provide a more spaceous feelVanity sink area removedMuch larger kitchen galleyBed is longer (80\") than CCD/SafariSmaller fridge than CCD/Safari (3 cu ft)3 vista view overhead windowsPorthole windows in outside door and bathroomLarger window in the kitchen galley above the sinkTV is at a much better viewing angleDinette is more suited to sleeping a child rather than 1 or 2 adultsStorage behind both seats in the dinetteFeatures:4,300# Axle system4,500#GVWR2 Steel Wheels Painted Glossy Black with Bright Round HubcapSteel Fold Away Step15\" Radial Tires12\" Electric Drum BrakesElectric Hitch Jack with Light4 Manual Stabilizer JacksSpare Tire with Steel Wheel and BracketBright Aluminum FinishPolished Rear BumperBambi MedallionWinick Design NameplateLicense Plater Bracket with LightGrab HamdleAluminum LP Bottle CoverInsulated and Heated Tanks9'8\" Curbside Patio AwningCurb Side and Road Side Awning RailMain Door with Round Opaque WindowStainless Steel Wrap ProtectorsSolar Stone Guard over Front WindowAluminum Enclosed and Insulated UnderbellyDiamond Plate Exterior Storage Area18\" Stack Windows and Three Vista View WindowsKeyed Deadbolt at Entry DoorSP Solar Grey Tinted Windows75th Anniversary InteriorAluminum Mini BlindsFull Close-Out Drapes at Front WindowsVeneer InteriorVinyl Flooring ThroughoutWood Faced with Steel Drawer BoxesOverheads with Slider DoorsAluminum Interior SkinTowel BarToiletRoll Away Shower DoorFiberglass Shower With Soap DishHinged Bath Door with Round WindowRear L-Lounge (converts to 48\"X75\" Sleepiong Area)Audio/Video Center With StorageSpice RackRound Stainless Steel Sink with Removable Cover40\" X 74\" Fixed Dinette11,000 BTU A/C with Heat Strip16,000 BTU Furnace3-Burner Cooktop with Oven3 Cubic Ft.

It has many unique features not included on following production models. I have also changed the floorplan to a much more open and roomy style.\nI am the original owner. There have never been any pets, smokers, or children in this trailer.\nThe following are things Airstream built in this trailer that are unique:\nThe beige berber carpet was used instead of the 'sharkskin' or salt and pepper carpet.\nThe bathroom has the glass door and an overhead cabinet above the sink. It also has a full entry door with a vented header instead of a large hole above the door.\nAll of the laminate is woodgrain. Only the counter top is white.\nIt has a 500lb. heavier axle.\nThe following are changes i personally made to the trailer to make it much roomier and more livable.\nEXTERIOR\n*I installed a rear bumper with a receiver and storage compartment. Oddly, no sport is made with a rear bumper. (the steel is 14\" into the trailer frame, fully welded)\n*I installed a Porch light.\nINTERIOR\n*The front dinette has been changed to an L-sofa, full 60\"wide queen bed with full storage underneath that can be accessed from the top or the front through the doors i have made. I also added 1.5\" memory foam in the cushions that make up the bed.\n*I made the folding dining table (just as the one airstream sells for 799.00),and it stows next to the sink.\n*There are full curtains throughout.\n*I replaced the completely inadequate kitchen sink, with a large stainless sink and moen faucet.\n*I installed aluminum counter molding throughout the trailer including the bathroom. It is much more attractive than the plywood edge from the factory.\n*There is a full lenght mirror on the closet door.\n*I built and installed a full length, 3 bay cabinet, above the sofa. It is made from Red Oak and has tambor doors.\n* I installed bullet lights under all the cabinets. They are directional, 12v, and very attractive.\n* I installed a large spice rack in the kitchen and bath areas as well as an oak cutting board.\n* I installed dual batteries and tires, new in 3-2012.\n* There is a 19\" tv/dvd combo.\nEverything i made is from Red Oak which matches the laminate used by Airstream in this trailer.\nEverything on this trailer works correctly. This trailer can be used immediately. It is currently located near Ouray, CO.\nPlease call 804-543-4770.\nThis trailer is in excellent condition. Weight is under 3600lbs and can be pulled by almost anything. It very comfortably sleeps 2 adults and 2 children.\nThe MSRP on the 2012 Safari Sport 22 is $46,000.00 and change, and the new floor plan has no where near the livability of this one.\nThank you for your consideration.","id":985,"listed_at":"2012-07-14T12:00:00-07:00","location":"Private","make_model":"22' Safari Sport","price":28000,"price_last":28000,"product":16360,"removed_at":"2012-07-31T22:25:45-07:00","size":22,"sold":false,"title":"2008 Safari Sport 22, the 1st one made,unique","updated_at":"2012-07-31T22:25:45-07:00","url":"http://www.airstreamclassifieds.com/showproduct.php?product=16360&cat=16","year":2008},{"created_at":"2012-07-23T22:25:09-07:00","days_active":60,"description":"","id":1010,"listed_at":"2012-07-23T12:00:00-07:00","location":"Panama City Beach, Fl","make_model":"Airstream Excella","price":16500,"price_last":0,"product":16450,"size":31,"sold":true,"title":"1985 Excella - 31'","updated_at":"2012-09-21T22:25:57-07:00","url":"http://www.airstreamclassifieds.com/showproduct.php?product=16450&cat=16","year":1985},{"created_at":"2012-07-21T22:25:12-07:00","days_active":67,"description":"1994 excella classic \u00a025 ft.

I am selling my Airstream travel trailer because I will be unable to use it much due to work. It is the model that was re-designed by Chris Deam (hence the CCD designation).\u00a0The trailer was purchased by me last summer from a seller in Redding CA. It was purchased new by the seller and was delivered to his vacation home where it had been parked from 2005 thru 2011 and used occasionally as a spare bedroom. It was in excellent condition when I bought it having been barely used. I had it thoroughly inspected and had a few repairs performed as well as several upgrades. I had installed an anti-sway hitch system, TV, under sink water filters, high quality mattress, wireless backup camera with monitor that attaches inside the truck, accordion shades, and new tires.The trailer has under 5000 miles that we have put on since then. It is in perfect wear and working condition. I often get asked if it is brand new.\nmore photos at\u00a0https://picasaweb.google.com/111217561286558765131/MyAirstream#I also wish to sell the tow vehicle. It is a 2005 Silverado 2500 HD with Duramax transmission. 4 X 4 extended cab with LT finishes. It has less than 90k miles and is also in perfect condition - there is not a scratch on it. Includes a camper shell with roof rack. It is a super nice rig with plenty of power to tow - you will forget the trailer is even back there. I can make you a special deal if you buy both trailer and truck. I am asking $24,500 for the truck only.\nmore photos of the truck at\u00a0\nhttps://picasaweb.google.com/111217561286558765131/ChevySilverado2500HD#Specs\nLT Pickup 4D 6 1/2 ft bedMileage is less than 88000 milesV8, 6.6L Turbo DieselAutomatic Transmission4 WDABS (4 wheel) brakingACPower windows, door locks, stearing, driver and passenger seatstilt wheel, cruise control, premium sound (Bose, XM radio)On-StarLeather seatsPickup shell (Lear) with roof rack (Thule)towing packageallow wheelsGrey interior and Victory Red exterior (regularly waxed with Zaino car polish, regular oil changed with Shell Rotella)Everything is in excellent condition.

Designer David Winick took the lead in creating an interior space that is both ultra modern and retrospective. Natural linoleum in warm tones brings out the highlights of genuine wood veneers. Upholstery inspired by 1940\u2019s tailoring heightens textural contrasts, reflecting in an array of aluminum surfaces. Porthole windows, round vents and yacht-inspired details further integrate the past and future in this very special travel trailer.\"\nLayout:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Dinette is is angled for easier access\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n*Significently more floor space (sofa slide-out) and transfer of fridge from street side to curb side\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n*Easier access to bathroom when bed converted to couch\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n*Combo bed/sofa - bed can optionally be converted to a couch for day use\n*Shoulder height cupboarders have been reduced in size to provide a more spaceous feel\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n*Vanity sink area removed\n*Much larger kitchen galley\n*Bed is longer (80\") than CCD/Safari\n*Smaller fridge than CCD/Safari (3 cu ft)\n*3 vista view overhead windows\n*Porthole windows in outside door and bathroom\n*Larger window in the kitchen galley above the sink\n*TV is at a much better viewing angle\n*Dinette is more suited to sleeping a child rather than 1 or 2 adults\n*Storage behind both seats in the dinette\n\nFeatures:\n\n4,300# Axle system\n4,500#GVWR\n2 Steel Wheels Painted Glossy Black with Bright Round Hubcap\nSteel Fold Away Step\n15\" Radial Tires\n12\" Electric Drum Brakes\nElectric Hitch Jack with Light\n4 Manual Stabilizer Jacks\nSpare Tire with Steel Wheel and Bracket\nBright Aluminum Finish\nPolished Rear Bumper\nBambi Medallion\nWinick Design Nameplate\nLicense Plater Bracket with Light\nGrab Hamdle\nAluminum LP Bottle Cover\nInsulated and Heated Tanks\n9'8\" Curbside Patio Awning\nCurb Side and Road Side Awning Rail\nMain Door with Round Opaque Window\nStainless Steel Wrap Protectors\nSolar Stone Guard over Front Window\nAluminum Enclosed and Insulated Underbelly\nDiamond Plate Exterior Storage Area\n18\" Stack Windows and Three Vista View Windows\nKeyed Deadbolt at Entry Door\nSP Solar Grey Tinted Windows\n75th Anniversary Interior\nAluminum Mini Blinds\nFull Close-Out Drapes at Front Windows\nVeneer Interior\nVinyl Flooring Throughout\nWood Faced with Steel Drawer Boxes\nOverheads with Slider Doors\nAluminum Interior Skin\nTowel Bar\nToilet\nRoll Away Shower Door\nFiberglass Shower With Soap Dish\nHinged Bath Door with Round Window\nRear L-Lounge (converts to 48\"X75\" Sleepiong Area)\nAudio/Video Center With Storage\nSpice Rack\nRound Stainless Steel Sink with Removable Cover\n40\" X 74\" Fixed Dinette\n11,000 BTU A/C with Heat Strip\n16,000 BTU Furnace\n3-Burner Cooktop with Oven\n3 Cubic Ft.

This unit comes with the Eddie Bauer package (with a quality large and smaller comforter along with comfortable pillows). Some accesories were never used and are still in the original plastic bags.

This Airstream is in wonderful condition, but please be realistic- it is used, it is not \"perfect\" there are minor imperfections I'm sure: The only things worth noting that I am aware of are a small scrape on the left rear of the trailer; on, and right above the rub-rail on the corner (there is a picture and you can't hardly see it, but it's there in person). From my understandingwhen the owners before me\u00a0were in Phoenix a couple of years ago there was a hail storm- the Airstream was under it's \"car-port\" luckily, but the wind was blowing and if you look closely in the pictures, you can see some \"dimples\" on the left front panel and a few (very minor ones) here and there on the left side, and left rear panel. In the daylight, the only ones you can really see are on that left front panel- it's weird, but at night or dusk you can spot the ones on the side. I tried to get them to show up in pictures, but they are very hard to see. Most people don't even notice unless you point it out to them. I would welcome and recommend that you come see it or have a 3rd party inspection.\u00a0E-mail and we can see about setting up a time to view the travel trailer.\u00a0Please understand that the description is only my opinion, yours may be different, I have done my best to take many pictures and describe the RV to the best of my ability. I reserve the right to end this listing at any time for any reason as the coach will be for sale locally as well. Payment methods accepted must be in the form of Certified funds, bank wire-transfer, or cash in person. Due to concerns of fraud, if you're paying via cashier's check, it must clear my account before the RV/title leaves my sight.","id":1017,"listed_at":"2012-07-25T12:00:00-07:00","location":"Tucson AZ","make_model":"Airstream Safari 70th Anniversary Edition Wide-Body","price":25000,"price_last":0,"product":16474,"size":23,"sold":true,"title":"2002 Airstream Safari Wide Body","updated_at":"2012-08-24T22:25:10-07:00","url":"http://www.airstreamclassifieds.com/showproduct.php?product=16474&cat=16","year":2002},{"created_at":"2012-09-12T22:25:06-07:00","days_active":30,"description":"Excella 1000 recently damaged by pine tree during hurricaine Issac.

The interior of the trailer is flawless and looks as though it has been used very little. The mattress is new and has been upgraded. It comes with all new bedding. The bathroom/shower looks as though it has never been used. The A/C is brand new and has been upgraded to the 15,000 BTU unit. The trailer has been inspected from front to back and detailed from top to bottom. We have found no evidence of smoking, pets, or water damage. I guarantee everything to be functioning properly. The exterior is in great shape as well but there are a few blemishes from normal use and the fact that the trailer is 10 years old (all can be seen in the detailed slideshow above). The trailer does include a Hensley Arrow Hitch with lifetime warranty ($3500). The trailer was also recently upgraded with hydraulic disc brakes! It has awnings all the way around it and they are all in excellent condition. The batteries and tires are 1 year old. The bearings and brakes have been recently serviced. The trailer comes with all the original owners manuals and everything you need to go camping: electrical cords, water hoses and fittings, sewer hoses and fittings, leveling blocks, etc. This trailer is ready to hit the road!

This gentleman has owned over 10  Airstream's in his lifetime starting way back in the 60s. A good friend  of the Airstream Community.   This Airstream is 28' in length, a wide body model, and many upgrades  including but not limited to: Rock Guards, Dual Side Awnings, Window  Awnings, cabinet upgrade and more. The exterior is in good shape (stored  in the barn hence the current \"look\" of it, we have yet to clean it),  the interior is in very nice shape, the fabric on the roof is coming  down, but we will be fixing that (known common occurrence in these  models, and it will look like new when we finish), and there is a side  window by the door missing, but we already have the window and can  install.  If you want to take this Airstream \"as is\" we can negotiate  further on the price.  To our knowledge all the appliances, plumbing, and propane work just  fine, but has not been gone through by us as of this posting. These  retail between $19-25k in similar condition. It's coming into the slow  time of the year, so we are just looking to move this fast. A great buy  no matter how you look at it. No leaks, No floor issues, no huge dents.
